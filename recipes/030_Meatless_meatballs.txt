1 1/2 cups walnuts, ground (make sure these aren’t rancid. Buy in bulk and taste first if you can. If you buy in a package, it shouldn’t look oily.)

4 ounces cheddar, grated

1/2 cups breadcrumbs

1/2 cup wheat germ (I use wholemeal flour)

1/2 onion, minced and sauted  til soft

3/4 cup milk

2 Tbs chopped parsley

salt and pepper

3 cups bechamel sauce (white sauce, seasoned with thyme and sauteed, diced onion; be sure to cook the onion well)

2 eggs

Mix walnuts, grated cheese, breadcrumbs, wheat germ or flour, onion and enough milk to make a mixture that holds together. (I generally use less than 3/4 cup so don’t add all the milk at once). Finally, add well-beaten eggs. Roll the mixture lightly into balls, slightly smaller than egg-size and put into an oiled baking dish. Pour the 3 cups of sauce over it. Bake at 375 – 400˚ for about 40 minutes.
