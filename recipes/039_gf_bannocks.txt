Gluten-free bannock (fry bread)
Makes about four pieces of fry bread (I made five but one was a bit smaller)

2 cups gluten-free all-purpose flour (I used Dove’s Farm Plain White Flour)
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 teaspoons xanthan gum
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup water, plus a bit extra if necessary (I added 1 tablespoon)
vegetable shortening for frying

Mix all dry ingredients together well. I like to use a pastry blender if I’m feeling too lazy to sift. A pastry blender is great at smushing any lumps and mixing everything well together.

Add 1 cup of cold water and mix until you have a slightly sticky dough. If it’s too firm, add a little extra water. I added 1 tablespoon. A pastry blender is great for this step too.

Make a ball out of the dough. Allow to rest at room temperate for 30 minutes, covered lightly with a clean tea towel.

Scoop out a hunk of dough – the size will depend on how big you want your fry bread to be, but mine mostly turned out a little smaller than a salad plate and I’d say my dough hunks were about the size of a small orange.

Lightly flour your working surface with the gluten-free flour. I actually just used a flat plate because I decided not to roll out my dough with a rolling pin. Maybe it’s the association with camping but I tend to think bannock shouldn’t be too perfect-looking. I just used my hands to flatten it out into a thinnish disc, probably about 5 mm where thinnest and up to 1 cm where thickest.

Put a generous pat of vegetable shortening (I use Trex as it’s not full of chemicals) into a frying pan and preheat to medium-high. Put the bannock in the pan and fry until it’s puffy in places and golden brown on the fried side. Flip over and fry the other side.
