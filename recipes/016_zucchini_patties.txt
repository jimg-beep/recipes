Zucchini Patties

INGREDIENTS

    * 2 cups grated zucchini
    * 2 eggs, beaten
    * 1/4 cup chopped onion
    * 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
    * 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
    * 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
    * salt to taste
    * 2 tablespoons vegetable oil

DIRECTIONS

   1. In a medium bowl, combine the zucchini, eggs, onion, flour, Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, and salt. Stir well enough to distribute ingredients evenly.
   2. Heat a small amount of oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Drop zucchini mixture by heaping tablespoonfuls, and cook for a few minutes on each side until golden.

The liquid from the zucchini absolutely needs to be squeezed out to make this work--otherwise it will be much too runny. Here is what I did: used 3 eggs instead of 2 (i had a bit more onion and zucchini than what was called for), added 3 cloves of pressed garlic, a 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes, 3/4 to a full cup of italian seasoned bread crumbs, and 1/2 c. of cheddar (on top of the other cheeses). Also, I lessened the amount of flour to maybe 1/4 c. Lastly, I sprinkled the patties with bread crumbs before frying.
