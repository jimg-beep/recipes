This forces me to get creative with what I can find on hand. A while ago, I realized that the mushrooms, baby zucchinis, and corn tortillas that I'd used for various other meals were going to have to be thrown away if they didn't get used. I dug around and found some pepper jack cheese, onion, and red pepper and realized that I had the makings for a great meal. Quesadillas are traditionally made with flour tortillas, but when I found the corn tortillas in my fridge I figured it was worth experimenting. I'm glad I did! These corn tortilla quesadillas were delicious, warm and spicy with that distinctive crunch of a fried corn tortilla. Perfect! It turns out people do use corn tortillas for quesadillas sometimes, I'd just never had the pleasure of trying one. Corn Tortilla Quesadilla Recipe serves as many as you want to make Ingredients: corn tortillas cheese * baby zucchini baby bella mushrooms (or white mushrooms) onion red bell pepper jalapeno (optional) * I used pepper jack cheese, but if you want something milder , use Monterey Jack or Mozerella. Feel free to substitute your favorite vegetables for any of those above! Toppings (all optional): salsa sour cream guacamole (recipe here ) Preparation Instructions: 1). Prepare your vegetables, using as much as you want to make for the amount of people you will be feeding. Wash the zucchini, mushrooms, red bell pepper , and jalapeno if you are using it. Slice the zucchini and jalapeno into rounds, the mushroom into bite-sized slices, and the red pepper into thin strips. Peel the onion and cut it into thin strips. 2). Grate your cheese, enough to cover as many quesadillas as you plan to make. 3/17/24, 12:44 PM Corn Tortilla Quesadilla Recipe: A Quick Meal ﬁle:///home/jfg/Mount/box 25GB/Recipes/Corn Tortilla Quesadilla Recipe A Quick Meal.htm 2/3Loading...3). Add some butter or mar garine to a cast iron skillet or non-stick pan and heat over medium (medium-low on a gas range) until the butter has melted. 4). Take one corn tortilla and cover it lightly in grated cheese. Place various vegetables across it, and then sprinkle a little more cheese over those. Cover in another corn tortilla, then carefully transfer it to the skillet. 5). Once the cheese has started to melt and the bottom has turned golden brown, flip the quesadilla to the other side until it too is golden brown. Remove from the skillet. 6). Cut into quarters and serve! These taste excellent with a little salsa dribbled over them. You can also add sour cream and guacamole if you want to (Great guacamole recipe here ).

A Satisfying 2-in1 Dish Comments 3 comments Go to last comment Jaime Sanchez 19 months ago quesadillas began with corn tortillas. soft corn torillas were folded in half around a piece of cheese, epazote herb, peppers, potatpes and chorizo then place on a griddle to melt the cheese or fried until golden. You are just used to going to resturants and being served gringo quesadillas, especially those chicken quesadillas. Flour tortillas are a \"T ex-Mex\" creation due to the introduction of trigo 'wheat' for flour . Just to set the record straight. Melissa Ray Davis profile image Melissa Ray Davis 17 months ago from Swannanoa, NC Hub Author Thanks Jaime, that makes sense. Perhaps what I should have said is \"flour tortillas are traditionally used in American Mexican restaurants.\" ;-) Aunt B 5 months ago Jaime, Thank you for that information! It gives me ammonition when people tease me for using Corn Tortillas. I cannot eat Wheat Flour and Corn Tortillas are a staple for me! Thanks again!

Combine oats and chickpeas in food processor and pulse a few times to roughly chop the chickpeas and oats. Mixture should look chopped but not be paste-like or wet/mushy. 4. Set aside and grab those veggies! 5. Remove the stem from the jalapeño. For spicier burgers, leave the veins and seeds intact. For less spicy burgers remove half or all of the veins/seeds. I left half intact and removed the rest for burgers with a spicy kick and lots of ﬂavor! \u0000. If you haven't already, grate the zucchini using the coarse side of a box grater and wrap in a paper towel. Squeeze out excess moisture and set aside. 7. Sauté bell pepper, jalapeño, zucchini and green onion in avocado oil until peppers are tender. \u0000. Season with garlic powder, red pepper ﬂakes, oregano, and salt. 9. Add the freshly sauteed veggies to your bean mixture, then add your egg. 10. Stir to fully incorporate and roll mixture into four balls. 11. To shape your burgers, cup each ball in your hands and squeeze tightly, rotating as you gently, but ﬁrmly, press it into a disc using your thumb. I like mine on the thiner side so middles cook all the way through, but not so thin that they won't hold their shape. 12. To help the burgers set, cover and refrigerate as you prep your buns or (lettuce wraps!) and toppings. This will give them a little while to set. You can even leave them overnight and cook them up the following day. I often make one after 15-30 minutes of chill time and cook up the rest the following day. 1. Pour a tablespoon or two of oil in a skillet and heat to medium-high, so the burgers sizzle when you add them to the pan! 2. Cook for a few minutes on each side until you're left with a golden crust. and a warm center. Repeat for each burger, or cook two at once if you have a big enough pan! I'd skip crowding all four together just because they're a pain to ﬂip when all up in eachother's business. 3. A tip for perfectly shaped veggie burgers: While sizzling away in the skillet, I nudge the burgers with the backside of my spatula to gently help form the sides into a perfect disc. Works like a charm! 4. Slather your buns with sriracha mayo, pile them high with lettuce, and top each burger with honey-lime slaw or your favorite toppings. Enjoy!",

He also likes to have it available to serve with his chicken tenders for children who come into the restaurant. For the base, Virant uses tomatoes his staff has canned during the summer, but store-bought tomato sauce also works.

Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and cook 5 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned. Transfer onion to a large mixing bowl. 2. To onion, add black beans, Monterey Jack cheese, rice, breadcrumbs, green onion, tomato paste, soy sauce, garlic powder, oregano, cayenne, cumin, and pepper. Mix well, mashing beans with a fork (or a potato masher, if you have one). 3. Working with clean hands or a burger press, mold burgers into 6 patties. Cover and chill. 4. Fire up the grill: For a charcoal grill: Open the bottom vents. Ignite 6 quarts or 2 1/2 pounds charcoal briquettes or hardwood charcoal. When the coals are hot, set up for a one-level medium-heat fire (so you can hold your hand 5 inches above the cooking rack for only 4 to 5 seconds). For a gas grill: Turn each burner to high and ignite. Cover the grill. When hot, set the burners to medium heat. 5. Brush tops of burgers with oil. On a charcoal grill: Brush the grill rack with oil. Grill burgers, oiled side down, uncovered, 4 minutes. Brush tops of burgers with oil, turn burgers, and grill 4 more minutes or until golden. On a gas grill: Brush the grill rack with oil. Grill burgers, oiled side down, uncovered, 4 or 5 minutes. Brush tops of burgers with oil, turn burgers, and grill 4 or 5 more minutes or until golden. 6. While burgers grill, toast cut sides of buns on grill for about 3 or 4 minutes. Place burgers on bottom of buns and serve, passing ketchup, mustard, relish, horseradish, lettuce and tomato slices. Variation: For an extra flavor kick, substitute an equal amount of shredded processed cheddar or processed Swiss cheese for the Monterey Jack cheese. Notes: It your veggie burgers don't stick together well, mix in 2 tablespoons water and try to form another patty These burgers stay formed better if they're refrigerated, covered, for at least 30 minutes before they head to the grill.",

In a medium bowl, combine the zucchini, eggs, onion, flour, Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, and salt. Stir well enough to distribute ingredients evenly. 2.

The liquid from the zucchini absolutely needs to be squeezed out to make this work--otherwise it will be much too runny. Here is what I did: used 3 eggs instead of 2 (i had a bit more onion and zucchini than what was called for), added 3 cloves of pressed garlic, a 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes, 3/4 to a full cup of italian seasoned bread crumbs, and 1/2 c. of cheddar (on top of the other cheeses).

Flavored with parsley and garlic for aroma and taste, it’ s totally yeast-free, gluten-free , and dairy-free (no yogurt required!), but it’ s so good no one would care! Make a fresh batch of this delicious naan and eat it as a side dish or appetizer (with this delicious slow cooker lentil curry, alongside our popular creamy hummus , baba ganoush , or even on its own)! INGREDIENTS UNITS US MSCALE1x 2x 3x INSTRUCTIONS★ 1 cup gluten-free all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum (omit if your gluten-free flour blend already includes it) 1/2 cup tapioca starch , plus more as needed 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 1 egg 1/4 cup warm water, plus more as needed 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil , plus more for brushing 1/4 cup fresh minced garlic, optional 1/4 cup fresh chopped parsley, optional 1. Combine Dry Ingredients: Combine all the dry ingredients (gluten-free all-purpose flour, xanthan gum (if using), tapioca starch, baking powder, and salt) in a large mixing bowl. 2. Whisk Wet Ingredients: In a medium bowl, whisk the egg, warm water, and olive oil together until combined. 3. Mix Wet and Dry Ingredients to Get Dough: Pour the wet mixture bit by bit into the bowl with the dry ingredients and mix with a spoon until you get a soft, pliable dough ball. (If the dough is too dry, add a sprinkle of warm water at a time, and knead until pliable. If the dough is too wet, add a sprinkle of tapioca starch until dough is no longer too sticky to handle). 4. Shape Dough into Round Disc: Use gluten-free floured hands to shape the dough ball into a round disc. 5. Cut Dough into Portions: Cut the round dough disc into 8 equal portions as you would a pizza. 6. Flatten Dough: Flatten each dough portion with your fingers or a rolling pin on a floured surfact until each piece of dough is roughly 1/8-inch thick. You want the dough to be as thin as possible without breaking so the naan doesn’t get too thick. 7. Prepare Garlic-Parsley Mixture: If using garlic and parsley, mix the fresh garlic and parsley together in a small bowl, and press around 1 teaspoon of garlic-parsley mix evenly on both sides of each piece of flattened dough. 7/16/23, 12:32 PM Best Gluten F ree Naan Br ead (No -Yeast, No -Yogurt, Dairy -Free) - Dish by Dish https://www .dishbydish.net/easy -gluten-fr ee-naan-br ead-no -yeast-dairy -free/print/20695/ 2/3NOTES S e r v e s 4 S e r v i n g S i z e : 2 n a a n C a l o r i e s P e r S e r v i n g : 2018. Heat Cast Iron Skillet: Heat a cast iron skillet over high heat and once hot, brush the skillet with olive oil. 9. Cook: Place a piece of flattened dough in the middle of the skillet and let it cook for approximately 40 seconds until air bubbles start to form at the surface of the dough and the bottom starts to char slightly. Brush the top of the dough with olive oil, flip it over, and let it cook for another 40 seconds before removing it from the skillet and placing it on a plate and covering it with a kitchen towel. 10. Repeat Until All Dough is Used: Repeat until all the naan is cooked and serve warm. Gluten-Free All-Purpose Flour: I recommend using a good-quality gluten-free all-purpose flour blend that is made of a mix of lighter flours/starches (such as rice flour , tapioca starch, corn starch or potato starch) to ensure a fluf fier texture. I do NOT recommend using a flour blend with heavier flours such as garbanzo bean flour as that will result in a denser texture. Xanthan Gum: Xanthan gum is a replacement for gluten in gluten-free baked goods, and helps to bind the ingredients together . If your gluten-free flour blend does not include xanthan gum, make sure to add it in. Tapioca Starch: You can substitute tapioca starch for the same amount of cassava flour or arrowroot starch. Basically this starch is necessary to give the naan bread a chewy texture. Baking Powder : I recommend using aluminium-free baking powder to prevent any “metallic” taste that may be present especially when making a recipe that requires baking powder in high quantities to give it the yeast-free rise. If you are Celiac or intolerant/allergic to gluten, make sure you use certified gluten-free baking powder . Egg: The egg in this recipe helps to bind the ingredients together . I personally haven’t tried making this gluten-free naan recipe without the egg, but if you are vegan or allergic to eggs, you can try using aquafaba or a flax egg. Water: You may substitute the water for the same amount of non-dairy milk (such as my 5-minute cashew milk or my easy homemade almond milk ). Alternatively , if you’re not lactose-intolerant, feel free to go ahead and use normal dairy milk. Olive Oil: I like the taste that extra virgin olive oil imparts to the naan, but if you don’t have olive oil (or simply prefer not to use it), you can use other oils such as sunflower oil or avocado oil instead. Cast Iron Skillet : I believe using a cast iron skillet will yield the best results, as cast iron mains high heat well and for a long time. However , if you don’t own a cast iron skillet, simply make sure to heat up your skillet very well before cooking the naan. Storing/Freezing: To store, place the cooled naan in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To freeze, place the cooled naan in a freezer-safe container or ziplock bag and freeze for up to 2 months. Let frozen naan thaw completely overnight in the refrigerator before heating it up and serving.

Place the dry ingredients (except the yeast and sugar or honey, if you're using it) into a large mixing bowl; the bowl of your stand mixer is perfect. Mix until thoroughly blended.1 Place the sugar or honey (if you're using it), warm water, 2 tablespoons (25g) olive oil, yeast, and about 1/2 cup (78g) of the dry mixture into a small bowl. Stir to combine; a few lumps are OK. Set aside for 30 minutes or so, until the mixture is bubbly and smells yeasty.2 Add this mixture to the dry ingredients, and beat on medium-high speed for 4 minutes. The mixture will be thick and sticky; if you've ever applied spackling compound to a wall, that's exactly what it'll look and feel like. Note: You must use a stand mixer or electric hand mixer to make this dough; mixing by hand doesn't do a thorough enough job.3 Cover the bowl, and let the dough rest for 30 minutes or so. 4 Preheat the oven to 425°F. 5 Drizzle 2 tablespoons (25g) olive oil onto the center of a baking sheet or 12\" round pizza pan. Scrape the dough from the bowl onto the puddle of oil.6 Using your wet fingers, start at the center of the dough and work outwards, pressing it into a 12\" to 14\" circle.7 Let the dough rest, uncovered, for 15 minutes. 8 Bake the crust for 8 to 10 minutes, just until it's set; the surface will look opaque, rather than shiny.9 Remove from the oven and top with whatever you like. Return to the oven to finish baking, about 10 to 15 minutes depending on the toppings you've chosen.10 Remove from the oven, and serve warm. 112/9/25, 1:33 PM Print Recipe | King Arthur Baking https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/gluten-free-pizza-crust-recipe 1/2 Tips from our Bakers We're here to help.

Food Stylist: Simon Andrews.Total Time 45 minutes Prep Time 5 minutes Cook Time 40 minutes Rating (36) I N G R E D I E N T S Yield:6 servings (20 slices) 1 large globe eggplant, sliced into ¼-inch-thick rounds (about 1¼ pounds) Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper ½ cup all-purpose flour 2 large eggs 3 cups panko bread crumbs 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning 1½ teaspoons garlic powder 1 cup canola oil, for frying Chopped fresh parsley, for serving Marinara sauce, for dipping (optional)P R E P A R A T I O N Step 1 Place the eggplant slices in a large bowl, sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and toss to evenly coat. Set aside for 10 to 20 minutes, then use a clean dish towel or paper towels to pat each slice dry, absorbing any water that has been released. Step 2 M eanwhile, place the flour in a shallow bowl or rimmed plate. Crack the eggs into a second bowl and beat them with a fork. In a third bowl, combine the panko, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, 1½ teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Step 3 W orking one at a time, dip the eggplant rounds into the flour, shaking off any excess, then into the egg mixture, and finally, into the panko mixture, coating each piece completely. Place on a paper towel lined plate until ready to cook. Step 4 These crispy breaded eggplant rounds make a delicious appetizer served with marinara sauce for dipping. The key to tender, creamy eggplant with a crisp, crunchy coating is slicing the eggplant thinly and salting it to draw out excess moisture before breading. Coated in seasoned panko, the eggplant rounds cook in under 3 minutes, meaning you can fry the whole batch in under 15 minutes and serve the rounds piping hot. If youʼre planning ahead, you can also bread the eggplant slices and refrigerate them on a paper towel lined plate for several hours before frying. Pour the oil into a large, heavy-bottomed skillet or Dutch oven and heat over medium-high. W hen the oil is hot (it should sizzle immediately if you drop a breadcrumb into the pan), carefully place a few eggplant slices in the pan. Adjust heat to medium and cook for 1 to 2 minutes on each side, until golden brown on both sides. Step 5 Transfer to the prepared plate, sprinkle lightly with salt and repeat with the remaining eggplant, adjusting the heat as necessary to prevent smoking. Sprinkle the eggplant with parsley and serve hot, with marinara sauce for dipping if you like. Private Notes Leave a Private Note on this recipe and see it here.",

    "content": "Cauliflower Shawarma With Spicy Tahini By Melissa Clark Total Time 45 minutes Rating (5,981) INGREDIENTS Yield:2 servings FOR THE CAULIFLOWER 5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed 1¼ teaspoons ground cumin 1¼ teaspoons sweet paprika ¾ teaspoon fine sea or table salt, plus more as needed 1 teaspoon ground coriander ¼ teaspoon ground turmeric ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Pinch of ground cayenne 1 large head cauliflower (about 2½ pounds), trimmed and cut into bite- size floretsPREPARATION Step 1 Arrange racks in the upper and lower thirds of your oven. Heat oven to 425 degrees. Step 2 Prepare the cauliflower: In a large bowl, whisk together olive oil, cumin, paprika, salt, coriander, turmeric, black pepper and cayenne. Add cauliflower and onion, and toss until well coated. Spread mixture in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Step 3 Roast vegetables on the top oven rack until they are golden brown, slightly crisp and tender, 30 to 40 minutes, stirring once or twice. If the vegetables look dry as they roast, drizzle with a little more olive oil. Step 4In this vegetarian take on shawarma, the usual spiced lamb, chicken or turkey is replaced with cauliflower florets and onion wedges that have been tossed with a classic combination of cumin, paprika and coriander, then roasted until browned, fragrant and very tender. A hot sauce-spiked tahini served alongside lends creaminess and heat. To serve it, you can tuck everything into a pita or flatbread, or keep the bread on the side and let everyone assemble their own sandwiches at the table. Chopped cucumber, tomatoes and olives are optional, but they add a juicy brightness to contrast with the aromatic, roasted flavors. (Watch the video of Melissa Clark making cauliflower shawarma with spicy tahini here.) 1 large red onion, cut into ¼-inch wedges Pita or flatbread, for serving ¼ cup coarsely chopped parsley, plus more for serving Chopped tomato, cucumber and olives, for serving FOR THE SPICY TAHINI SAUCE 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, plus more to taste 1 to 2 teaspoons harissa paste or other hot sauce, or a large pinch of Urfa or Aleppo pepper, plus more to taste 1 fat garlic clove, finely grated, passed through a press or minced ¼ teaspoon fine sea or table salt ⅓ cup tahini ⅓ cup ice water, plus more as neededAs they cook, prepare the tahini sauce: Whisk together lemon juice, 1 teaspoon harissa, garlic and salt in a small bowl, and let sit for a minute or two to mellow the garlic. Whisk in tahini. Whisk in ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the sauce is smooth and thin enough to drizzle. You may not need all of the water or you may need to add a little more: Tahini brands vary a lot. Taste and adjust seasoning, adding more harissa, lemon juice and salt if you like. The sauce should taste zippy and creamy. Step 5 Warm the pitas or flatbread by placing them directly on the bottom oven rack during the last 5 minutes as the vegetables roast. (Or you can warm the bread on another baking pan if that’s easier for you.) Step 6 Scatter parsley on top of the roasted vegetables and serve with warm pitas, tahini sauce, chopped tomato, cucumber and olives.

The pickled onions aren’t strictly necessary, but they are simple to make and add a welcome tangy contrast to the beans. Pickled peppers are a fine substitute. If you have a bell pepper or jalapeño or two, chop them up and sauté them with the onions. And if you want to be fancy, grate the zest off the lime before juicing for the pickles, and stir it into the sour cream. Step 1 Make the pickled onions: Squeeze lime juice into a bowl, and add onion, salt and sugar. Let rest while you make the chili. Step 2 Prepare the chili: Heat a large skillet over medium-high. Add the oil. When hot, add onion and sauté until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic, chile powder and oregano and sauté until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Add beans and tomatoes and a few large pinches of salt and let simmer until the tomatoes break down, about 20 minutes. Step 3 Taste and add more salt, chile powder and/or oregano to taste.

This spicy, hearty, chickpea-based Indian dish is vegan and gluten free. It makes great leftovers, too! Be sure to prep the ingredients in advance, as the recipe moves quickly. Recipe yields 4 bowls. Ingredients 1x 2x 3x 1 cup uncooked brown basmati rice, for serving (rice is optional, I like to cook extra to have on hand for other meals) 2 tablespoons coconut oil or extra-virgin olive oil 1 medium yellow onion, chopped 1 medium serrano or jalapeño pepper*, minced (remove ribs and seeds to tame the spice level) ½ teaspoon ﬁne sea salt, to taste 5 cloves garlic, pressed or minced (about 1 tablespoon) 1 tablespoon peeled and minced fresh ginger (about a 1-inch piece) 1 ½ teaspoons garam masala** 1 ½ teaspoons ground coriander ¾ teaspoon ground cumin ½ teaspoon ground turmeric Pinch of cayenne pepper (optional!*)3/5/25, 4:08 PM Quick Chana Masala Recipe - Cookie and Kate https://cookieandkate.com/quick-vegan-chana-masala/print/23522/ 1/3 1 large can (28 ounces) ﬁre-roasted crushed tomatoes or whole peeled tomatoes, with their juices 2 cans (14 ounces each) chickpeas (or 3 cups cooked chickpeas), rinsed and drained Lemon wedges, for garnish Fresh cilantro, for garnish (optional) Instructions 1. Cook the rice (if you want to serve the chana masala on rice): Bring a large pot of water to boil on the stove and rinse the rice in a ﬁne-mesh colander. Once boiling, pour in the rice and give it a stir. Boil the rice for 30 minutes, then turn oﬀ the heat and drain the rice. Return the rice to the pot and cover the pot. Let the rice steam for 10 minutes. Remove the lid, ﬂuﬀ the rice with a fork and season with sea salt to taste. 2. Cook the chana masala: In a medium Dutch oven or large saucepan, warm the oil over medium-low heat. Add the onion, serrano and salt. Cook until the onion is tender and turning translucent, about 5 minutes. 3. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Stir in the garam masala, coriander, cumin, turmeric, salt and cayenne (if using), and cook for another minute, while stirring constantly. 4. Add the tomatoes and their juices. If using whole tomatoes, use the back of a wooden spoon to break the tomatoes apart (you can leave some chunks of tomato for texture). 5. Raise the heat to medium-high and add the chickpeas. Bring the mixture to a simmer. Cook, reducing the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer, for 10 minutes or longer to allow the ﬂavors to develop. Season to taste with additional salt, if desired. If it’s not spicy enough for your liking, add another pinch of cayenne. 6. Serve over basmati rice, if desired, and garnish with a lemon wedge or two and a sprinkle of fresh cilantro leaves. Notes Recipe adapted with permission from The Oh She Glows Cookbook by Angela Liddon. *Tame the heat: While chana masala is inherently full of spice, the serrano (or jalapeño) and cayenne pepper are what bring the heat. If you’re sensitive, reduce or omit them both. You can always stir in a pinch of cayenne pepper at the end of cooking if you want more.3/5/25, 4:08 PM Quick Chana Masala Recipe - Cookie and Kate https://cookieandkate.com/quick-vegan-chana-masala/print/23522/ 2/3 **Spice blend note: Garam masala is traditional. If you don’t have it and want to get by without making another trip to the store, you could use tikka masala instead, or perhaps even 1 teaspoon yellow curry powder. Don’t have any of those? I suspect this dish would be nicely ﬂavorful with an added pinch of clove and cardamom, or even nothing at all. Storage suggestions: This recipe makes for great leftovers! Store the rice, chana masala and garnishes separately for best results. Warm the rice and chana masala together, then garnish with fresh lemon wedges and cilantro. Leftovers should keep well for up to 5 days. I believe you could also successfully freeze the chana masala and rice components for later. Change it up: Though untraditional, I think this would taste great with a generous splash of coconut milk for some creaminess (it would also mellow the spices somewhat). Update 3/18/20: The recipe originally called for cumin seeds (1 ½ teaspoons) instead of ground cumin. I made the switch because ground cumin is easier to ﬁnd. The recipe called for cooking the cumin seeds in the oil before adding the onion, etc. (Cook for a minute or two, stirring frequently, until the seeds are golden and fragrant. Watch carefully to avoid burning the seeds.)

To prepare the tofu, remove the tofu from its package and drain out the water. Wrap the tofu with paper towels or a clean dishcloth. 2. Place tofu on a chopping board and stack with another ﬂat plate or chopping board. Then weigh it down with something heavy such as cans or cartons. Let the tofu drain for about 10- 15 minutes. Remove and place the tofu back into its package and freeze overnight. 3. When ready, thaw the tofu to room temperature and squeeze the tofu between your palms to remove the liquid. 4. Then, cut into 2 big slabs. I trimmed the sides to make it look like a cutlet but this is an optional step. Season both sides generoulsy with salt and pepper. 5. Next, set up the dipping station: Place ﬂour, plant-based eggs, and panko breadcrumbs on 3 separate plates. 6. Take a tofu slab and coat each side generously with ﬂour. Then, dip it into the plant-based egg until coated and drip off excess. Finally, lay the tofu on the panko and gently press to get the panko to stick until all sides are well coated. 7. Heat ½-inch vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. To test if the oil is ready, drop a small piece of panko into the oil. If it sizzles, then the oil is ready. 8. Carefully slide the tofu into the hot oil. The tofu should sizzle as soon as it touches the oil. Use a pair of tongs to lift a corner to check the color. 9. Once the tofu is golden, slowly turn them over and fry the other side. Note: if it's browning too quickly, lower the heat just a little. 10. When ready remove and transfer katsu to a drain rack. This will keep the katsu crispy until ready to use. The katsu is ready to be served as-is with a side of rice. 1. Skip this step if you are using store-bought curry cubes. 2. To make the curry roux, melt the butter in a pot over medium-low heat and whisk in the ﬂour. Stir the mixture while cooking until it starts to turn brown. This process takes about 10-12 minutes. 3. Then, add the garam masala, curry powder, and cayenne pepper. Stir until well-combined and set it aside until ready to use or refrigerate once it's cooled. 1. To prepare the curry, melt butter in a pan and sauté the mushrooms until aromatic. Then, transfer it to a plate and set it aside. 2. Using the same pan, add more cooking oil and sauté onions until they caramelized. 3. Add the carrots, potatoes, and mushrooms and cover the ingredients with vegetable stock.3/5/25, 4:00 PM Tofu Katsu with Japanese Curry - WoonHeng https://woonheng.com/wprm_print/tofu-katsu-with-japanese-curry 2/3 Notes I'm using a large onion which yields about 1 ¼ cups after chopped The peach preserve is absolutely optional. Skip if you have a large Fuji apple or you prefer a less sweet version Curry Roux recipe is from JustOneCookbook4. Place a lid over and bring the mixture to a boil, then lower the heat and let it simmer. Check the potatoes' tenderness with a fork or chopstick. 5. Meanwhile, blend the apple into a puree. 6. Once the potatoes are fork-tender and fully cooked through, season with soy sauce, salt, apple, and peach preserves (if using). 7. Using a sieve, stir the curry roux into the broth. The broth will slowly turn darker. Test and season if needed. 8. To serve, add a few spoons of rice to a plate and then, top with tofu katsu and ladle the hot curry over. Serve warm a side of shredded cabbage.3/5/25, 4:00 PM Tofu Katsu with Japanese Curry - WoonHeng https://woonheng.com/wprm_print/tofu-katsu-with-japanese-curry 3/3",

Add 1 cup of cold water and mix until you have a slightly sticky dough. If it’s too firm, add a little extra water. I added 1 tablespoon. A pastry blender is great for this step too. Make a ball out of the dough. Allow to rest at room temperate for 30 minutes, covered lightly with a clean tea towel. Scoop out a hunk of dough – the size will depend on how big you want your fry bread to be, but mine mostly turned out a little smaller than a salad plate and I’d say my dough hunks were about the size of a small orange. Lightly flour your working surface with the gluten-free flour. I actually just used a flat plate because I decided not to roll out my dough with a rolling pin. Maybe it’s the association with camping but I tend to think bannock shouldn’t be too perfect-looking. I just used my hands to flatten it out into a thinnish disc, probably about 5 mm where thinnest and up to 1 cm where thickest. Put a generous pat of vegetable shortening (I use Trex as it’s not full of chemicals) into a frying pan and preheat to medium-high. Put the bannock in the pan and fry until it’s puffy in places and golden brown on the fried side. Flip over and fry the other side.",

In a lar ge bowl, place the flour , xanthan gum, tapioca starch/flour , salt, and baking powder , and whisk to combine well. Add the oil, and mix to combine. 2. Add the milk, and mix until the mixture comes together . If necessary to bring the dough together , knead together with clean hands. The dough will be thick but relatively soft. 3. Ideally , divide the dough into 5 ounce portions (as written, the dough makes 2 portions), wrap each tightly in plastic wrap, and chill for 30 minutes and up to 3 days. You can also work with the dough immediately , if you don’ t have time to chill it. 4. When you’re ready to make the flatbreads, heat a cast iron skillet that’s at least 10-inches in diameter , or a heavy-bottom nonstick skillet, over medium-low heat. Place a flat, wide spatula and a tea towel on the counter next to the skillet. 5. If you’ve chilled the dough in portions, unwrap and work with one piece at a time. If the dough hasn’ t been divided, divide it in two equal halves, each weighing about 5 ounces. 6. Turn each piece of dough out onto a very lightly floured flat surface, and sprinkle lightly with extra flour . Cover the other piece(s) of dough loosely with a cloth to prevent it (them) from drying out. 7. Sprinkle the dough lightly with more flour and begin to roll it into a round, sprinkling lightly with more flour as necessary to prevent sticking. The edges will be jagged and a bit rough. 8. Gather the dough together and repeat the process at least once more, until the dough is smoother . Roll the dough into an approximately 10-inch round, turning and flouring lightly as necessary . The edges should be less rough, but this is rustic flatbread. 9. Brush about 1 tablespoon of neutral oil on the hot skillet. Pick up the prepared raw piece of flatbread and place it flat in the center of the skillet, taking care not to bend any of the edges.

You must use tapioca starch (or flour , they’re the same thing) in this recipe in addition to a proper all purpose gluten free flour blend. You cannot use Expandex modified tapioca starch. They’re completely dif ferent ingredients. Rolling in a tea towel . You absolutely do not have to roll the warm flatbreads in a tea towel. This is designed to create a “memory” in the dough for rolling, so that they will bend perfectly even as they cool. Adapted from Curious Cuisinier e.

Slide the spatula underneath the flatbread, ensuring that there are no spots that might stick. 11. Flip the flatbread over and allow it to cook for another minute, pressing it firmly back onto the skillet with the spatula to prevent it from puf fing up. You can also take a toothpick and prick any bubbles to deflate them. 12. Continue to cook the flatbread, flipping it frequently , until it is set on both sides and doesn’ t glisten anywhere. It should take 2 to 3 minutes total. Remove the flatbread from the skillet, place it in the center of the tea towel (See Recipe Notes), and fold the edges of the towel over on it to enclose it. 13. Repeat with the other piece of dough, oiling the skillet lightly as necessary . 14. Once the flatbreads are done cooking but are still very warm, open the tea towel and remove both pieces of bread. Place one about 4 inches from one short end of the towel, fold the edge over the bread, and roll the bread tightly in the towel. 15. Place the second flatbread on the unrolled portion of the towel, and repeat the process, rolling until the two flatbreads are tightly wrapped in the towel. Allow them to cool for at least 5 minutes wrapped in the towel before unwrapping and serving.",

But sometimes a little variation can be fun. These potato pancakes have a few delicious surprises without straying too far from the original. The pancake batter has a mix of sweet and regular potatoes, as well as some jalepeño for kick. The sweet potatoes add a caramel note that goes well with the cheese sauce, which is made by cooking onions, peppers, and garlic until they are very soft, then adding queso fresco cheese for creaminess and a little tang. Prep Time: 15 minutes Cook Time: 40 minutes Total Time: 55 minutes Ingredients: 1/3 cup finely chopped onion 3/17/24, 12:36 PM Spicy Potato Pancakes with Queso Fresco Sauce - Recipe for Potato Pancakes with Spicy Cheese Sauce ﬁle:///home/jfg/Mount/ramdisk/Recipes/Spicy Potato Pancakes with Queso Fresco Sauce - Recipe for Potato Pancakes with Spicy Che… 2/52 cloves garlic, minced 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 red or orange bell pepper , chopped very fine 2 jalapeño peppers, minced (about 4 tablespoons) 1 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon chile powder (or to taste) 2 tablespoons flour 1 cup vegetable broth 3/4 cup crumbled queso fresco cheese (or farmers cheese, or mild feta) 1 large white potato 1 large sweet potato 2 eggs 3 tablespoons flour Vegetable oil and butter for frying Salt and pepper to taste Preparation: 1. Sauté the onions and garlic in the olive oil until golden and soft. 2. Add the chopped pepper , 2 tablespoons minced jalapeño, cumin, chile powder , and salt to taste. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes on low heat, until vegetables are golden and very tender . 3. Raise heat to medium. Stir in 2 tablespoons flour and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add 1 cup vegetable broth, lower heat, and simmer for 10 minutes, until most of the liquid is evaporated and you have a thick sauce. 4. Stir in the cheese and cook over low heat, stirring constantly , until cheese has blended into the sauce. Keep sauce barely warm while you prepare the pancakes. 5. Peel and finely grate the potatoes. Press grated potatoes between paper towels to remove excess water . 6. Stir 2 eggs, 2 tablespoons minced jalapeño, and 3 tablespoons flour into the potatoes. Season generously with salt. 7. Heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil and 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet on medium heat. 8. When oil is hot, add tablespoons of potato batter to skillet. Flatten and shape into round pancakes with a spatula. Oil should be hot enough that pancakes sizzle gently . 9. Cook pancakes for about 2 minutes on each side, or until golden brown, pressing down gently with spatula. Drain on a plate lined with paper towels, and repeat with rest of batter . 10. Pancakes can be kept warm in a 200 degree oven for up to 30 minutes, on a cookie sheet lined with paper towels. 11. Serve pancakes warm with cheese sauce. Makes about 15-20 pancakes.

Indian food is not just curried sauces. This spin on an Indian chickpea curry features a healthy mixture of chickpeas, tomatoes, onion, and spices.

Recipe by latinmama | Updated on March 7, 2023 Tested by Allrecipes Test Kitchen Step 1 Grind onion, tomato, ginger, garlic, and chile pepper together in a food processor into a paste. Step 2 Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry bay leaves in hot oil until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour the paste into the skillet and cook until the oil begins to separate from the mixture and is golden brown in color, 2 to 3 minutes. Season the mixture with chili powder, coriander, gram masala, turmeric, and salt; cook and stir until very hot, 2 to 3 minutes. Step 3 Stir enough water into the mixture to get a thick gravy; bring to a boil and stir chickpeas into the gravy. Reduce heat to medium and cook until the chickpeas are heated through, 5 to 7 minutes.

I used a 3 quart sauce pan and it seemed like the perfect fit. Saute onions until they are transparent, tender, and begin to brown, about 6 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for about 1 minute more. Add the tomato paste, salt, and all of the spices to the pan. Stir until the tomato paste is evenly distributed, and the spices are fragrant, about 1 minute. Add brown sugar, vinegar, and crushed tomatoes. Stir to combine. Let mixture simmer over low heat for about 45 minutes. Mixture will thicken to a ketchup consistency. Stir occasionally. Remove pan from heat, and use an immersion blender to blend to the chunky ketchup smooth. If you don’t have an immersion blender, you can carefully place the warm ketchup in a regular blender to blend smooth. Just be sure to leave the blender lid slightly ajar so the warm contents don’t burst. After using either an immersion or regular blender, strain ketchup through a fine mesh strainer into a clean bowl. This will remove any unwanted seeds. I leave mine chunky cause I’m dirty like that. Get into it. Taste and adjust seasoning as necessary. Store ketchup in glass jars in the fridge. Ketchup will last for up to 1 month in the fridge! 9/30/24, 5:10 PM Homemade Spicy Ketchup - Joy the Baker https://joythebaker.com/2013/07/homemade-spicy-ketchup/ 2/4 says: says: says: says: says: says: says: says: says: says: says: says: says: says: says: says: says: says: says: says: says: says: says:TRACKBACKS LEAVE A REPLY RELATED POSTS IN GLUTEN-FREE FRESH BAKED EM AILS, DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX HI!

Add chopped onion and fry on a low heat until almos t translucent, stirring from time to time. 1. Add chopped garlic. Keep on stirring frequently until the onion is translucent and garlic softens c ompletely and releases its beautiful aroma. 2. Add all the ground spices to the fried onion and garlic mixture and stir them around well. Fry them of f gently for a minute or two stirring the whole time as they burn easily. 3. Add tomato paste to the pan and stir it into the onion and garlic mixture. 4. Squash plum tomatoes with a potato masher in a separate bowl before adding them to the pan. Add toma toes to the pan, salt and half of the sugar. Let the sauce thicken by simmering it on a low heat with no lid on. Give the sauce a good stir from time to time. 5. Once the sauce thickens, taste it and season with some black pepper and more sugar if needed. I used 3 tsp of sugar in this recipe as my tomatoes were quite tangy, but you may not need as much. 6. Stir in cooked chickpeas and let them warm through. Now add in the spinach and place the lid on to let spi nach wilt and cook in the steam. If you are not in a rush, you can gently pan-fry the spinach in a little olive oil and garlic separately and then add it to the dish, but tha t’s optional. 7.

Curr y powder - Use HO T if you want it spicy , or mild if not. Use any curr y powder - not intended t o be a full on authentic Indian r ecipe. I'v e used all the major br ands sold at A ustralian supermark ets (Keens, Cliv es, Ho yts, Master foods) and the y're all tasty . 2. Chilli powder - this is pur e ground chilli, for spiciness so adjust t o taste. Chili powder in the US is a spice mix that' s not v ery spicy . If you can 't get pur e ground chilli powder , sub with ca yenne pepper . 3. Ghee is clariﬁed butter used in Indian cooking. Tastes lik e rich butter . Not essential in this r ecipe. 4. Rice - basmati is ideal for this r ecipe, the nutty ar oma adds t o the o verall ﬂa vour. Can also use other plain white rice - long gr ain or jasmine (best subs), medium*, shor t grain* or sushi rice*. Not suitable for: Br own rice, black rice, wild rice, paella, or risott o rice. Not tried with quinoa. * Rice is stickier , such is the natur e of those rices. How I rinse rice: Either place in colander and run under water for 30 seconds, mo ving rice about with your hands, until water runs pr etty clear . Or do this in a bowl, swishing rice ar ound and changing water 4 times or so. Dr ain rice well befor e using. No need t o soak rice for this r ecipe - I found it didn 't mak e a diff erence t o ﬂuﬃness. 5. Br oth/st ock - Be sur e to use low sodium br oth (st ock), other wise it will end up t oo salty . If you use a stock powder , bouillon cube or concentr ate + hot water t o mak e broth, then omit the salt completely . 6. GENERAL : - Scaling r ecipe: If y ou scale down, be sur e to use a smaller pot other wise the rice won 't cook e venly. - Don 't use a fork t o ﬂuff basmati rice, it br eaks the long gr ains.

Food Stylist: Barrett Washburne.Total Time 40 minutes Prep Time 10 minutes Cook Time 30 minutes Rating (529) I N G R E D I E N T S Yield:4 servings 1½ pounds broccoli, cut into 1½- to 2-inch-long florets, stems sliced ¼-inch thick 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Salt and pepper 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped ¾ packed cup/3 ounces coarsely grated extra-sharp CheddarP R E P A R A T I O N Step 1 Arrange a rack at the bottom of the oven and heat to 425 degrees. On a parchment paper-lined sheet pan, toss the broccoli with the oil and season with salt and pepper. Arrange in a single layer, cut sides down, and roast on the bottom rack, without flipping, until browned and crisp-tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Step 2 Sprinkle the broccoli with the garlic, stir to combine, then spread the broccoli in an even layer. Sprinkle with the Cheddar, then roast until the cheese is melted and nearly all golden brown, 6 to 9 minutes. Let cool a few minutes for the cheese to crisp. Use a spatula to transfer the broccoli and all the cheese to plates. Private Notes Leave a Private Note on this recipe and see it here. With frizzled florets and crisp-tender stems, roasted broccoli is pretty delicious on its own. Follow Step 1 if you need a go-to basic method, or keep going for broccoli all dressed up in lacy skirts of Cheddar. Store-bought grated cheese will work, but freshly grated cheese will have an easier time surrendering to the heat of the oven. Let the cheese go past melted to just golden brown, at which point it will crisp into chips on your florets. Serve the broccoli alongside chicken cutlets, sausage or refried beans — or eat it straight from the sheet pan with your fingers.",

It’s so good and easy, you’ll never go back to store-bought sauce again. You can even make a double batch and freeze half of it for later. Recipe as written below yields about 2 cups (16 ounces) sauce. SCALE1x 2x 3x INGREDIENTS 3 tablespoons olive oil 3 tablespoons flour (whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour and gluten-free flour blends all work!) 1 tablespoon ground chili powder (scale back if you’re sensitive to spice or using particularly spicy chili powder) 1 teaspoon ground cumin ½ teaspoon garlic powder ¼ teaspoon dried oregano ¼ teaspoon salt, to taste Pinch of cinnamon (optional but recommended) 2 tablespoons tomato paste 2 cups vegetable broth 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar or distilled white vinegar Freshly ground black pepper, to taste★ 11/10/2021 How to Mak e Enchilada Sauce - Cookie and K ate https://cookieandk ate.com/enchilada-sauce-r ecipe/print/24083/ 2/3Save recipes, create shopping lists, meal plans and more. ADD TO SHOPPING LIST INSTRUCTIONS 1. This sauce comes together quickly once you get started, so measure the dry ingredients (the flour, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, oregano, salt and optional cinnamon) into a small bowl and place it near the stove. Place the tomato paste and broth near the stove as well. 2. In a medium-sized pot over medium heat, warm the oil until it’s hot enough that a light sprinkle of the flour/spice mixture sizzles on contact. This might take a couple of minutes, so be patient and don’t step away from the stove! 3. Once it’s ready, pour in the flour and spice mixture. While whisking constantly, cook until fragrant and slightly deepened in color, about 1 minute. Whisk the tomato paste into the mixture, then slowly pour in the broth while whisking constantly to remove any lumps. 4. Raise heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook, whisking often, for about 5 to 7 minutes, until the sauce has thickened a bit and a spoon encounters some resistance as you stir it. (The sauce will thicken some more as it cools.) 5. Remove from heat, then whisk in the vinegar and season to taste with a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. Add more salt, if necessary (I usually add another pinch or two). Go forth and make enchiladas! NOTES Enchilada sauce recipe adapted from my spinach artichoke enchiladas . Storage suggestions: Extra enchilada sauce will keep well in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Or, freeze it for up to 3 months. Let it cool to room temperature before transferring to a wide-mouth mason jar, leaving some room at the top for expansion (don’t screw on the lid completely until the mixture is fully frozen), or a freezer bag (remove excess air before sealing). Make it gluten free: Just use gluten-free all-purpose flour blend. I tried with Bob’s Red Mill brand and it worked great. Make it tomato free: You can omit the tomato paste. You might want to up the spices a bit. The sauce won’t taste quite like the enchilada sauce you might buy at the store, but it will still be good! Change it up: The chili powder, cumin and garlic powder are essential here, but feel free to change up the other spices to suit your preferences.

Feel free to make some common-sense substitutions: If you don’t have mayo, sour cream or ranch dressing will work great. A couple of large dried chiles, soaked and peeled , can easily stand in for the canned ones. And, of course, you should add or subtract seasonings to suit your tastes. Place the oats, nuts, mayonnaise, and drained chiles in the bowl of a food processor. Add about 2 tablespoons of liquid from the beans. Pulse until you have a rough paste, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Let this mixture sit while you prepare the beans. Thoroughly drain the beans and spread them out in a large nonstick or well- seasoned cast iron skillet. Cook over over medium-high heat for 5-8 minutes, stirring once or twice, until they’re totally dried out and starting to split.

Add as many patties as you can and let them cook until they’re dry on top and firm to the touch. This will take at least 4-5 minutes for thin patties and 6-8 for thick ones. They’ll fall apart if you flip them too soon, so don’t touch! Use the downtime to toast buns, slice onions and tomatoes, and get your other condiments ready. Flip the burgers and cook until the underside is brown, another 3-5 minutes depending on thickness. Serve on toasted buns with your favorite toppings.
